### On Waiting Room,

> With a span of six and a half minutes, Waiting Room is one of Phoebe's longer and less popular songs but definitely having a place in the hearts of the Pharbz or Phoebe's fanbase. Moreover, the song itself starts off acoustic and ends with an uproar of instruments; that almost of a ballad. A melancholic ballad, as the song's lyrics and Phoebe's singing reflects that of yearning and wanting something seemingly at arm's reach but still unattainable.
> Looking at the song's structure, it is an unconventional song approach as it follows a verse-verse-chorus pattern with the chorus being the words 'know it's for the better' repeated over and over again which is longer and progressively louder than the two verses combined. Moreover, I interpret this as the singer's undying and unhealthy yearning for this person which I and many other avid fans of Waiting Room relate to.

The song starts with a student-teacher analogy for someone the singer likes. One may interpret this as from the start, the connection the singer yearns for has been problematic from the start. And the singer relating them to a teacher could mean something about this person having authority over the singer by simply existing.
