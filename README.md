> With a span of six and a half minutes, Waiting Room is one of Phoebe's longer and less popular songs but definitely having a place in the hearts of the Pharbz or Phoebe's fanbase. Moreover, the song itself starts off acoustic and ends with an uproar of instruments; that almost of a ballad. A melancholic ballad, as the song's lyrics and Phoebe's singing reflects that of yearning and wanting something seemingly at arm's reach but still unattainable.
> Looking at the song's structure, it is an unconventional song approach as it follows a verse-verse-chorus pattern with the chorus being the words 'know it's for the better' repeated over and over again which is longer and progressively louder than the two verses combined. Moreover, I interpret this as the singer's undying and unhealthy yearning for this person which I and many other avid fans of Waiting Room relate to.

> The song starts with a student-teacher analogy for someone the singer likes. One may interpret this as the connection the singer yearns for has been problematic from the start. And the singer relating them to a teacher could mean something about this person having authority over the singer by simply existing.
> The second line has themes of self-destruction and self-sabotage. Where despite the singer has the tools and the capability to get over this infatuation and move on to something better, they choose to bleed out in the pain that is unrequited love.
> The third and fourth lines are no different, with the singer showing their undying love and also yearning to be an active part of this person's life.
> The fifth line however is a complete change. The fifth line can be interpreted as inside, the singer has already acknowledged and has accepted how futile this yearning is and is brought back to reality and reassures themselves with the line 'I know it's for the better.'

> The first line of the second verse reminds me of when a Syrian boy's dead body was found ashore in Greece after fleeing the war during the Syrian Migrant crisis. I interpret this as with all the bad things going on in the world, the singer feels guilty for wanting this connection so bad in the lines 'who am I to ask for more?'
> The second line is a personal favorite of mine, *'But you're breathing in my open mouth, you're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out.'* This line is so powerful to me as the singer recognizes the person they love so as the reason they live (breathing in my open mouth = CPR = life) but also is a trigger for their self-destruction and is also the reason why they *need* them in order to live in the first place.
> The following lines only add to the singer's love and obsession and is also revealed that the singer is a teenage girl.
> It is also worth nothing that althroughout the first and second verses, the lines shift from 'if you', 'I want' into 'I can', 'I know' and 'you are' showing the singer's slow progression into realizing that this connection is never and never has been for them.

> The song ends with the chorus with the line 'Know it's for the better' repeated 35 times. The chorus is the ultimate culmination of the singer's feelings and finally accepting that despite everything that she wanted from her love interest, it was not for her and she retreats to comforting herself with telling herself that it's for the better. It is also worth nothing that at the start of the chorus, it almost sounds like she's saying 'No, it's for the better' with her being in denial at first due to her intense feelings.

> In a live performance of this song, Phoebe takes a gentler, subtler but undoubtedly emotional take on the song. In this version specifically too, she cuts the chorus shorter and adds a new line.

### 'I never grew up with you, and you're not my waiting room.'

> This line to me is Phoebe herself finding acceptance and genuinely moving on which we were unsure of in the recorded version.
